# A-visit-to-BOOTSTRAP-An-open-source-JavaScript-framework

In this exercise, I create a "clone" of a facebook profile page. My objective is to re-create the layout, features, and style of the Facebook profile page as closely as possible by following the below specifications:

* A static (fixed to the top of the window) site header with a logo, search bar, and navigation.
* Cover photo, profile photo, and some navigation buttons.
* Sidebar on the left with "about me" information, photo thumbnails, and friends thumbnails.
* Main content column with a form to add a new post.
* At least two posts on the page. At least one post needs to include a photo. All posts need the following:
  * Post content 
  * Like button with some likes
  * Add comment form

* A static sidebar on the right with two ads.
